# Grade Calculator

Goal: Calculate the final grade given the weight of each homework, midterm, final exam and lab report. 

The students are split into lecture and labs. Lecture accounts for 85% of the final grade and labs for 15%. The labs and lecture are taught by different instructors.

## The lab data
* The last two columns represent quiz 1 and quiz 2. Each quiz is graded on the scale of 0-20. Each quiz is worth 10% of the lab grade.
* Columns 1-12 are grades from lab reports. They are graded in the scale of 0-100. The lowest two should be dropped when calculating the final lab grade, take the best 10 out of 12. The lab reports are worth 80% of the lab grade. The students must have minimum of 10 labs to recieve a passing grade.

## The Lecture data
There are two midterms and a final:
* The lowest midterm is worth 20% and the highest 35%.
* The final exam is worth 45%.
